The seaside town of Gloucester, Massachusetts is a place where the smell of the ocean lingers in the air and the rocky coast glistens in the Atlantic sunshine.

Frightened and burdened by secrets, she meets Joyce Tabachnik -- a freelance writer with literary aspirations -- and a once-in-a-lifetime friendship is born. Joyce has just bought a small house in Gloucester, where she hopes to write as well as vacation with her family. Like Kathleen, Joyce is at a fragile place in her life. A mutual love for books, humor, and the beauty of the natural world brings the two women together. They share their personal histories, and help each other to confront scars left by old emotional wounds. With her own trademark wisdom and humor, Diamant considers the nature, strength, and necessity of adult female friendship. ""Good Harbor"" examines the tragedy of loss, the insidious nature of family secrets, as well as the redemptive power of friendship.Anita Diamant."

But most of all, it's a story about families--about the things that tear them apart and bring them together. And Holm tells it with all the richness and the layers, the love and the laughter of a Sunday dinner at Nonny's. So pull up a chair and enjoy the feast! Buon appetito!Jennifer L. Holm.
